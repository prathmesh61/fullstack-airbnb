Welcome to an unparalleled Airbnb experience with our cutting-edge Next.js 13 Full Stack clone! We've meticulously crafted this platform using the latest technologies, ensuring a seamless and robust user experience. Harnessing the power of libraries such as Zod for schema validation, React Hook Form for streamlined form management, and Next.js for efficient server-side rendering, we've created a high-performance application that's both dynamic and lightning-fast.

Behind the scenes, our backend relies on MongoDB for secure and scalable data storage, while NextAuth handles authentication with ease. The integration of custom hooks enhances code reusability and maintainability, contributing to a codebase that's not only feature-rich but also developer-friendly.

Whether you're a traveler seeking the perfect accommodation or a host looking to showcase your property, our Airbnb clone provides a user-friendly interface that caters to your needs. Embrace the future of web development with our Next.js 13 Full Stack clone, where innovation meets functionality for an unmatched Airbnb experience.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
